        OMNI NATURE TECH FOUNDATION focus on green infrastructure,
        renewable energy , recycling of waste produced ,water treatment systems towards the society, related to sustainability. Sustainability is the ability to exist and develop without Depleting natural resources for the future.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
        There are many benefits to sustainability, both short-term and long-
        term. We cannot maintain our Earthâ€™s ecosystems or continue to
        function as we do if more sustainable choices are not made. If
        harmful processes are maintained with no change, it is likely that we
        will run out of fossil fuels, huge numbers of animal species will
        become extinct, and the atmosphere will be irreparably damaged.
        Clean air and nontoxic atmospheric conditions, growth of resources
        that can be relied upon, and water quality and cleanliness,
        are all benefits of sustainability.
